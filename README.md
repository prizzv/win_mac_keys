WinMacKeys: For people who want to remap their Mac keys and shortcuts to be similar to those on Windows.


## Steps to add these shortcuts


Step 1: Download and install Karabiner Elements for mac from the official [download page](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/)

Step 2: Give what every permissions it requires

Step 3: Adding rules/shortcuts

There are two ways you could go about doing it 

### 1. Adding rules using the UI 
After opening the Karabiner Elements app under the complex modifications select add your own rule and copy and paste the rules json you require

 
### 2. Adding rules directly via editing the karabiner.json file

In `/Users/<user_name>/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json` you can directly update/add the `rules` key in the json with what every rule you want.
